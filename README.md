This serves as an illustration of an application featuring straightforward business logic. The emphasis throughout the entire project was on leveraging AWS technologies. The focus wasn't directed towards UI/UX or comprehensive functionality, but rather on showcasing the seamless integration of fundamental AWS servicesâ€”a valuable reference for future projects.

### What AWS services were implemented?

1. Amplify: This versatile tool seamlessly manages various AWS services, providing robust capabilities for authorization, authentication, and CI/CD processes.
2. API Gateway: Integral to the system, it facilitates streamlined access to resources within databases.
3. Cognito: Serving as the user pool manager, Cognito ensures secure and efficient user authentication.
4. IAM: Utilized for crafting roles and policies, IAM enhances access control and security measures.
5. DynamoDB: This dynamic database solution excels in storing and retrieving data swiftly and efficiently.
6. Lambda: At the core of backend services, Lambda offers scalability and an event-driven architecture for optimal performance.
7. CodeCommit: Functioning as the repository for code, CodeCommit integrates seamlessly with Amplify, playing a key role in the CI/CD pipeline.

### Other important technology?

1.  React Toolkit Query: that is used for async calling of Amplify CRUD functions anc caching the results.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`, in frontend folder

To everything that is needed, and then:

### `npm start`
